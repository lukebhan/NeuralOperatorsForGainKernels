# Neural Operators for Bypassing Gain and Control Computations in PDE Backstepping

The source code for the paper titled Neural Operators for Bypassing Gain and Control Computations in PDE Backstepping ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14265)).

## Sysetm Requirements
All of the code is written in Python 3 and relies on standard packages such as numpy, Pytorch, Scipy, and the 
deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde). Additionally, all code
in this work is nicely formatted in a jupyter-notebook. A basic installation
will require the installation of Python, jupyter along with DeepXDE and PyTorch. Please see the 
import statements in the Jupyter-notebooks to make sure all files are included.
